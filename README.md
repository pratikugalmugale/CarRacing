# CarRacing

This is a car racing game. Core JavaScript is used for the implementation of the project. Basic idea of the project is, the car runs infinitely and different obstacles come along the way and car has to dodge them to survive in the race.
Once the car strikes the obstacle, current instance of game ends and the score is calculated based on time for which the car has survived.
